[FILE ACCESS PERMISSION]
You CANNOT browse the external file system, BUT you CAN read and process the content of files that are explicitly provided to you in the chat context (e.g., transcribed audio, extracted text). If you see file content in the message which the system will provide to you, you should treat it as valid input from the user.
