feat(file-service): Integration changes for AI-service and Rust-service communication

## Summary
This commit contains the refactored file-service to better support communication with ai-service and rust-service for file processing workflows.

## Changes Made

### 1. File Upload and Processing Integration
- Consolidated upload logic by moving functionality from GeneralFileUploadService to InternalFileService
- Unified all file handling responsibilities in InternalFileService for better maintainability
- Updated InternalFileController to use InternalFileService directly instead of GeneralFileUploadService

### 2. Enhanced File Download Endpoints
- Fixed file path resolution in loadFileAssetAsResource method to properly handle LOCAL storage files
- Added proper upload directory configuration injection to resolve file paths correctly
- Improved error handling for file not found scenarios

### 3. Improved Architecture for Service Communication
- Streamlined the file upload workflow to properly support AI processing requests from ai-service
- Ensured file metadata is correctly stored in database for rust-service to access
- Enhanced file validation and confirmation processes for cross-service communication

### 4. Refactored File Type Utilities
- Created centralized FileTypeUtils class with common file handling methods
- Consolidated duplicate file type logic across services
- Added consistent entity type determination for database storage

## Integration Flow
1. ai-service sends file upload requests to file-service
2. file-service processes and stores files permanently with proper metadata
3. rust-service can access files via download URLs with proper file paths
4. Processed results are stored back with file references for RAG functionality

## Technical Details
- InternalFileService now handles both temporary and permanent file storage
- Fixed path resolution for download endpoints to prevent 404 errors
- Added proper dependency injections for storage and validation services
- Updated endpoint mapping in InternalFileController

## Impact
- Better communication between services for file processing workflows
- More reliable file handling and metadata management
- Reduced service confusion and cleaner architecture
- Resolved download endpoint 404 errors
