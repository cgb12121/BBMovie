feat(ai-service): Complete audio processing integration

Integrate WhisperService for automatic audio transcription in file upload flow.

Features:
- Audio files are automatically transcribed using WhisperService
- Transcription text is included in chat message context
- Audio processing runs separately from other file types (blocking operation)
- Supports multiple audio formats: mp3, wav, ogg, m4a, flac

Implementation details:
- FileProcessingService orchestrates audio upload and transcription
- Audio files are uploaded to file-service first (persisted)
- Then transcribed using WhisperService.transcribe()
- Transcription is appended to message context for AI processing

Files:
- service/impl/FileProcessingServiceImpl.java (audio processing logic)
- service/WhisperService.java (already existed, integrated)
- service/impl/WhisperServiceImpl.java (already existed, integrated)
